## Using the API

The Realtime Product Hunt API has been built with simplicity in mind. All you need to do is subscribe using [one of Pusher's free platform libraries](http://pusher.com/docs/libraries) and decide what you want to do with each post.

[Here's an example](http://jsbin.com/sikel/2/edit?html,js,console) that uses JavaScript and outputs each new post to the browser console:

```html
<!-- Include the Pusher JavaScript library -->
<script src="http://js.pusher.com/2.2/pusher.min.js"></script>

<script>
  // Open a Pusher connection to the Realtime Product Hunt API
  var pusher = new Pusher("7c1db8905b12d9aa6a03");

  var phChannel = pusher.subscribe("ph-posts");

  // Listen for new posts
  phChannel.bind("new-post", function(post) {
    // Output post to the browser console
    console.log(post);
  });
</script>
```
